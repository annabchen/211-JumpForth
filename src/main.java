public class main {
    // main takes input

    // run or begin or while method which contains all calls to other methods so main is clean :>
    // at beginning, start tracking runtime
    // at end, print runtime

    // stringInterpreter method which interprets input string word by word, then separates them into:

    // 1. a constants method to process the integer constants

    // 2. an instructions method to process the instructions
}
